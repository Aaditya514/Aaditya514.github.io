## ⚡ React + Vite Minimal Setup

This project uses **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** for a lightning-fast development experience and hot module replacement (HMR), paired with **React** for modern UI development.

### ✨ Official Vite Plugins

Choose one depending on your preferred compiler:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)** – Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)** – Uses SWC for even faster Fast Refresh.
